 ### ✨ Overview
 The Backtesting Engine is a quantitative trading simulation framework written in C++ for performance
 with a Python interface for strategy scripting. It allows traders, researchers, and developers
 to rigorously test trading strategies before deploying to live markets.

 ### 🚀 Current features include:
 - Fast, event-driven C++ simulation core
 - Market data ingestion from CSV or API
 - Order management with queue priority & latency simulation
 - Portfolio & PnL tracking
 - Python bindings (via pybind11) for strategy scripting
 - High-level Python API (buy(), sell(), etc.) without exposing raw orders

 ---

 ### ⚡ Installation
 Clone the repo and build with CMake:

 git clone https://github.com/johndcode/BacktestingEngine.git
 cd BacktestingEngine
 mkdir build && cd build
 cmake ..
 make -j4

 The C++ binary will be located at:
 build/engine

 Python bindings will be available after:
 pip install .

 ### 🛠️ Usage

 1. Define a Strategy in Python
 Strategies interact with the engine via a clean, high-level API:

 from backtesting import StrategyContext

 class MyStrategy:
     def on_bar(self, ctx: StrategyContext, bar):
         if bar.close > bar.open:
             ctx.buy(quantity=10)
         else:
             ctx.sell(quantity=10)

 2. Run Backtest
 Pass historical data into the engine:

 python run_backtest.py --data ./data/AAPL.csv --strategy MyStrategy

 ➡️ Produces portfolio performance, order logs, and risk metrics.

 ### ⚙️ Core Components

 - Engine → Core C++ simulation loop
 - MarketDataFeed → Feeds bars/ticks from CSV or API
 - Order & OrderManager → Limit, market, stop; queue priority handling
 - Portfolio → Tracks cash, positions, PnL, buying power
 - StrategyContext → Python-facing API for order submission
 - Latency Model → Simulates execution delay
 - Corporate Actions Handler → Adjusts for splits/dividends

 ---

 ### 🔮 Roadmap
 Planned features for future versions:
 - Support for short-selling with margin constraints
 - Slippage & market impact simulation
 - Survivorship bias elimination (data cleaning tools)
 - Walk-forward testing & cross-validation modules
 - Expanded metrics: Sharpe, Sortino, drawdowns, exposure
